### Why we started

Nerdwerk exists to deliver digital products that favour clarity, care, and meaningful outcomes.
We are a small group of designers and engineers who enjoy building things that people actually
use and love—and we thrive when we can iterate quickly with our partners.

### What you'll find here

The journal is a snapshot of our work in progress. Expect notes on process, breakdowns of
experiments in design and development, and reflections on the lessons we pick up along the way.
We'll also share announcements and behind-the-scenes looks at the tools that keep us moving.

### What's next

We're lining up deep dives into the systems that power our client work and some lightweight
frameworks we rely on internally. Subscribe to the feed (coming soon) or check back regularly if
you'd like a front-row seat.
